A sound card if you need sound<br>

<h1><a name="Instalation">Instalation:</a></h1>
<br>
<br>
Extract the game to the desired directory and run the game
(Dominators.exe).<br>
<br>
<h1><a name="Compilation">Compilation:</a></h1>
<br>
This was developed using dev-c++ so it will be very easy for you to
download and install this IDE rather than try to compile it with
another IDE.<br>
The compilation requires you to copy these folders found in
NonStandardHeaders to your include directory boost, fmod, lua.<br>
The game is made using a libary that one of our group members has been
working on in his spare time.<br>
It includes clases for texture management, sound, vectors, networking
and other game related stuff. It is not as well commented as the game
code because it was never intended to be read by other people :)<br>
<b>The libary must be compiled first before the game itself, the file
projects.dev should be opened using dev-c++ to compile projects.a<br>
The source specific to the game though can be found in
"/projects/games/dominators"</b><br>

<h1><a name="Story">Story:</a></h1>
<br>
A race of aliens called The Dominators is feared throughout the galaxy.<br>
They love technology and love stealing it from other races even more.<br>
The main defense/weapon used throughout the galaxy are neo-tanks, <br>
these tanks can fire an array of different beam, laser or cannon fire
and they <br>
can also be upgraded to become even more powerful.<br>
The game (Dominators) centers around the Dominators sending the newest
recruit Adel for his initiation: <br>
he must take over the planet Telos with his custom built neo-tank and
steal their technology from their <br>
Technology Centre.<br>
The user controls Adel.<br>
You must shoot the incoming aliens trying to defend their Tech Centre.<br>
There will however be one boss after the first enemies are defeated.<br>
He must be defeated to acquire the Telosians technology.<br>
Power ups will also be used that can augment the abilities and
artillery of Adel&#8217;s neo-tank.<br>
<br>
<h1><a name="Enemies">Enemies:</a></h1>

Adel's tank (the main tank)

Enemy A: Fastest moving tank but slow on the draw
<img src="../tanks/Tank1%20Full%2064x64.bmp"><br>
Enemy B: Second fastest tank, and good shooting speed as well these
tanks tend to survive the longest
<img src="../tanks/Tank3%20Full%2064x64.bmp"><br>
Enemy C: Not the worst when it comes to speed but makes up for it in
its rapid fire.

Enemy D: Fastest shooter

Well you get a textured quad, a bounding box, some collision detection
and you can make this game :)
