You need dev-c++

actually now you need wx-dev-c++
wxdsgn.sourceforge.net

You cannot compile this project with the source provided, it is here to serve as a back up copy of the most recent version.

To compile you need to download my game libary and copy this directory into /games/gldoteater.
http://raptor85.com/try_catch_this/projects.exe
actually raptor85.com is down permanently I have to upload a new version :)
that means you cant compile this project

Also you need to edit the file commctl.h so that INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX is defined.

/* define _WIN32_IE if you really want it */
#if 1
#define _WIN32_IE	0x0600
#endif

And finally: copy boost and fmod from NonStandardHeaders to the include directory.
