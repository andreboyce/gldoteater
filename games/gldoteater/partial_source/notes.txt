There is a bug caused by some kind of mathematical error (rounding error maybe). 
In dev c++ I got one result and now in visual studio I get another result.
In render.cpp uncomment the lines to see the tile position.
Somewhere in the projects folder I found the file with the bug need to update.
Move off solid tile is a good place to start

savegame.php was lost when the server hosting it went down. 
Sould rewrit it, it used to provide the hiscore list and i think match making between two clients.

have to replace the backgrounds in the artwork
