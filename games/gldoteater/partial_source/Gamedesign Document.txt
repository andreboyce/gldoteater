A race of aliens called The Dominators is feared throughout the galaxy.  They love technology and love stealing it from other races even more.  

The main defense/weapon used throughout the galaxy are neo-tanks, these tanks can fire an array of different beam, laser or cannon fire and they can also be upgraded to become even more powerful.  

The game (Dominators) centers around the Dominators sending the newest recruit Adel for his initiation: he must take over the planet Telos with his custom built neo-tank and steal their technology from their Technology Centre. 

The user controls Adel.  You must shoot the incoming aliens trying to defend their Tech Centre.  There will however be one boss after the first enemies are defeated.  He must be defeated to acquire the Telosians technology. Power ups will also be used that can augment the abilities and artillery of Adel’s neo-tank.
