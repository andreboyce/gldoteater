<H1>AStar</H1>
To set a map for path finding you must edit the solidity of each tile. The solidity is a measure of how easy it is to pass through the tile. Currently the max solidity (1000) represents that a cannot be passed through at all, but a tile with a solidity of 999 can be passed through however it will this implementation of AStar will ignore it unless the alternative path has a higher cost.

Use this dialog to set the solidity of the current selected tile, it will apply to all tiles with that index.
