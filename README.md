### Notes

I wrote this game along time ago. The plan was to make a pong clone, then a pacman clone, then a side scroller, then an rpg. Each of them should be multiplayer networked.

Recompiling this in Visual Studio Community was a pain took several weeks to sort most of the errors. Not to mention that with every version os VS community there are more changes.

Back when I wrote this I used no unit tests only application testing.
